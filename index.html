            <p class="about__description">
                My journey into the world of technology began in high school, where I discovered a deep fascination with programming. Starting with C, I embarked on an adventure of self-discovery, exploring and mastering various programming languages. This insatiable curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering at the <a class="description__link" href="https://www.udg.mx/es">University of Guadalajara</a>, where I am currently in my final semester.
                <br>
                <br>
                During my academic journey, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of software development principles and methodologies. I have honed my skills in designing, developing, and testing software applications, equipped with the ability to translate technical concepts into clear and concise solutions.
                <br>
                <br>
                My passion for programming extends beyond the classroom. I actively participate in online communities, engaging with fellow programmers and contributing to open-source projects. This has not only enriched my technical knowledge but also fostered a collaborative spirit and a commitment to continuous learning.
